Purpose: Eliminate template cruft from original starter and prepare navigation for AI transparency feature.
Output: Clean codebase without portfolio files, navbar with llms.txt viewer icon.

**Tech stack available:**
- Astro 5.15.4 with file-based routing
- Lucide icons (@lucide/astro) for SVG icons
- Tailwind CSS 4.1.14 for styling

**Established patterns:**
- Components use PascalCase naming (Header.astro)
- kebab-case for page files (works.astro)
- Path aliases: @/ → src/

**Context:**
This is the first phase of a major personalization iteration. The prototype was built from a portfolio template and contains unused "works" (portfolio) pages that don't belong in a dental health product site. The menu.json shows the intended navigation (Produkte, Wissen, Beratung, Dashboard, Über elmex) with no "Works" section.

The llms.txt viewer icon will enable users to explore the AI context/training data - a transparency feature for the future AI chatbot functionality.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Remove unused portfolio template files</name>
  <files>src/pages/works.astro, src/pages/work/luonmodels.astro, src/pages/work/3dvalentine.astro, src/pages/work/ricoblog2024.astro, src/components/sections/WorksSection.astro, src/components/sections/FeaturedWork.astro, src/collections/works.json</files>
  <action>
    Delete all portfolio-related files that don't belong in the elmex dental health site:

    1. Delete pages: src/pages/works.astro and all files in src/pages/work/
    2. Delete components: src/components/sections/WorksSection.astro and src/components/sections/FeaturedWork.astro
    3. Delete data: src/collections/works.json
    4. Delete assets: public/assets/works/ directory (contains portfolio project images/videos)

    Do NOT remove:
    - src/components/cards/WorkCard.astro (might be reusable for product cards)
    - public/assets/blog/ (blog is part of "Wissen" section)

    Verify no broken imports remain by checking if any files still reference WorksSection or FeaturedWork components.
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Files deleted: ls src/pages/works.astro src/pages/work/ src/components/sections/WorksSection.astro src/components/sections/FeaturedWork.astro src/collections/works.json public/assets/works/ (all should return "No such file")
    2. No broken references: grep -r "WorksSection\|FeaturedWork\|works\.json" src/ returns no results
  </verify>
  <done>Portfolio template files removed, no broken imports, codebase contains only elmex-relevant pages</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add llms.txt viewer icon to navbar</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/Header.astro</files>
  <action>
    Add an llms.txt viewer icon to the rightmost position of the navbar navigation:

    1. Import FileText icon from @lucide/astro at the top: `import { FileText } from '@lucide/astro';`
    2. In the desktop navigation (inside the nav tag, after the menu items loop), add a link to /llms.txt:
       ```astro
       <a
         href="/llms.txt"
         target="_blank"
         class="hidden sm:flex items-center gap-1.5 px-3 py-1.5 text-sm text-neutral-600 hover:text-[#FF6B35] transition-colors"
         title="View AI Training Context"
       >
         <FileText class="w-4 h-4" />
       </a>
       ```
    3. Position it after the existing menu items, before the mobile menu toggle
    4. Use elmex brand color (#FF6B35 orange) for hover state
    5. Icon only (no text) to keep navbar clean
    6. Opens in new tab with target="_blank"

    Note: The llms.txt file itself doesn't need to exist yet - it will be created in Phase 7. The icon just needs to be positioned correctly.
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. Dev server: npm run dev
    2. Visit http://localhost:4321 and check navbar
    3. FileText icon appears rightmost in desktop view
    4. Icon has hover effect with orange color
    5. Clicking icon attempts to navigate to /llms.txt (404 is expected for now)
  </verify>
  <done>llms.txt viewer icon visible in navbar (desktop), positioned rightmost, hover effect working, links to /llms.txt</done>
</task>
